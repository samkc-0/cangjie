The basic flow (what your fingers actually do)
	1.	Type the Cangjie letters
	•	Example: 明 → AB
	2.	Character appears automatically
	•	If it’s unique, it pops in right away.
	•	If there are multiple matches, you’ll see a candidate list.
	3.	Confirm / choose
	•	Press Space → confirms the first candidate
	•	Or press 1–9 → choose a specific candidate

That’s the core loop.

What the space bar does (important)

Space = confirm
It does not insert a space until a character is already committed.

So:
	•	Typing letters + Space → output a Chinese character
	•	Space again → actual space

This trips everyone up at first 😅

⸻

Other keys you’ll use a lot

Enter / Return
	•	Confirms the current character (same as Space in most setups)
	•	Also moves to a new line

Backspace
	•	Before confirming: deletes the last Cangjie letter
	•	After confirming: deletes the whole character

Esc
	•	Cancels the current composition
	•	Clears the candidate list

⸻

If you typed the wrong thing
	•	Before Space → just Backspace and fix the letters
	•	After Space → Backspace deletes the character, then retype

⸻

Switching between Chinese & English

Depends on OS, but usually:
	•	Shift or Ctrl + Space
	•	Or a language toggle key (🌐 / 中英)

Once in English mode, space works normally again.

⸻

Punctuation & numbers
	•	Numbers (1–9): select candidates
	•	0: often selects the 10th candidate
	•	Punctuation usually maps to Chinese-style punctuation:
	•	, → ，
	•	. → 。
	•	? → ？

(You can usually switch to Western punctuation in settings.)

⸻

What it feels like once you’re used to it
	•	Type a few letters
	•	Glance (or don’t) at the candidate
	•	Space
	•	Keep going

Very rhythmic. Almost like stenography once it clicks.
